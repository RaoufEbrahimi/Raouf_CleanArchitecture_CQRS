# .NET 8 Clean Architecture with CQRS, Repository Pattern, Generic Repository & Result Pattern

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Clean Architecture** in a .NET 8 application, using **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**, the **Repository Pattern**, a **Generic Repository**, and the **Result Pattern** via **ErrorOr\<T\>**. The project is designed with scalability, maintainability, and testability in mind, leveraging modern development practices and a modular structure.

## Technologies and Frameworks
- **.NET 8.0**: The latest version of the .NET framework for building scalable and efficient applications.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used for database interactions, with support for SQL Server.
- **MediatR**: Implements CQRS, providing decoupled and maintainable messaging between components.
- **FluentValidation**: Used for enforcing validation rules in a clean and reusable manner.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures APIs using JWT tokens.
- **Swagger (Swashbuckle)**: API documentation generation and testing.

## Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture
This project adheres to **Clean Architecture** principles, which separate concerns into distinct layers:
- **Domain Layer**: Contains core business logic, domain models, and interfaces that define the system.
- **Application Layer**: Manages the applicationâ€™s use cases, implementing the CQRS pattern to separate write and read operations.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external concerns like database access, file systems, or third-party services.
- **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for interacting with the client, including APIs and web interfaces.

**Benefits**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Enhances code clarity and maintainability by organizing the system into distinct layers.
- **Testability**: Easier to unit test each layer independently due to clear boundaries.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
The project employs the **CQRS pattern** by separating commands (write operations) and queries (read operations). This improves scalability and performance, especially in complex systems.

- **Commands**: Found under `Features\*\Commands`, these handle creating, updating, or deleting data.
- **Queries**: Found under `Features\*\Queries`, these handle data retrieval and ensure that read and write operations are not mixed.

**Benefits**:
- **Performance**: Optimized read and write operations.
- **Scalability**: Read and write models can evolve independently.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation leads to easier understanding and debugging of operations.

### Repository Pattern & Generic Repository
The **Repository Pattern** is implemented to abstract away the data access logic and provide a clean API to the rest of the application. A **Generic Repository** is used to reduce code duplication and provide reusable CRUD operations for various entities.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements repository classes that interact with **Entity Framework Core** to manage data persistence.
- **Generic Repository**: Provides a common interface for basic CRUD operations, ensuring consistency across different data models.

**Benefits**:
- **Decoupling**: Application logic is decoupled from data access logic.
- **Reusability**: The generic repository allows reuse of CRUD operations across different entities.
- **Testability**: Easier to mock and unit test without depending on a specific database implementation.

### ErrorOr\<T\> Result Pattern
In the **Domain Layer**, the project employs the **ErrorOr\<T\>** feature as a **Result Pattern** to handle operation outcomes in a clean and consistent manner. This pattern allows methods to return either a successful result of type **T** or an error, encapsulating both success and failure scenarios in a single, predictable return type.

- **Success Case**: Returns a valid result (e.g., domain entity or value).
- **Error Case**: Returns a defined error or set of errors when the operation fails.

**Benefits**:
- **Unified Handling**: Provides a clear and unified approach to handling success and failure, reducing the complexity of error handling across the system.
- **Type Safety**: Enforces compile-time checking of errors, ensuring that all possible outcomes are handled.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Reduces reliance on exceptions and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

### Separate Application Layers
This project considers two separate **Application Layers**:
- **Admin Application Layer**: Manages the business logic specific to administrative functionalities.
- **Web Audience Application Layer**: Handles the logic for public-facing web functionalities.

By separating these layers, the project maintains clean boundaries between the logic intended for different types of users.

**Benefits**:
- **Isolation of Concerns**: Ensures that logic specific to admin and public users are kept separate.
- **Scalability**: Allows for each layer to evolve independently without affecting the other.
- **Maintainability**: Improves clarity and organization by separating business rules for different roles.

## Validation
Validation is handled using **FluentValidation**, which ensures that the application data is valid before processing it.

- **Validation Rules**: Placed in the application layer, alongside the business logic for commands and queries.

**Benefits**:
- **Separation of Validation Logic**: Clear and maintainable validation rules.
- **Reusability**: Validation logic can be reused across different parts of the application.

## Security
The application uses **JWT Bearer Authentication** for securing API endpoints.

- **JWT**: Ensures secure access control by validating tokens in API requests.

**Benefits**:
- **Security**: Protects API resources from unauthorized access.
- **Scalability**: Lightweight and scalable authentication mechanism.

## Logging
Logging is implemented using **Serilog**, with sinks configured for **SQL Server**.

- **Serilog**: Provides structured logging capabilities to monitor application performance and errors.

**Benefits**:
- **Visibility**: Provides insights into system behavior and errors.
- **Flexibility**: Logs can be sent to various outputs (e.g., console, SQL Server).

## Testing
The project includes unit tests, employing **xUnit** as the testing framework. It follows best practices in unit testing to ensure the integrity of each component.

- **Test Project**: Contains unit tests for commands, queries, and domain logic.

**Benefits**:
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that each component behaves as expected.
- **Maintainability**: Helps prevent regressions when making changes.

## Documentation & API Testing
- **Swagger**: Integrated using **Swashbuckle**, provides interactive API documentation and allows for easy testing of API endpoints.

**Benefits**:
- **Ease of Use**: Developers can interact with and test API endpoints easily.
- **Clarity**: Clear API documentation for consumers.

## Conclusion
This .NET 8 project showcases how to implement **Clean Architecture**, **CQRS**, the **Repository Pattern**, the **ErrorOr\<T\>** Result Pattern, and separate application layers for the **Admin** and **Web Audience** projects. By leveraging modern technologies and patterns, it ensures maintainability, testability, and ease of expansion.

Please note that this project is still a **work in progress**, and I will continue to improve and enhance it with additional features and refinements. I'm eager to receive **feedback** and **contributions** from the community to help further its development.
